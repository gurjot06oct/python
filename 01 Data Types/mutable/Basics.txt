i. List is an ordered data structure because its items can be accessed by indexing.
ii. Tuple is an ordered data structure because its items can be accessed by indexing.
iii. Set is an unordered data structure because its items cannot be accessed by indexing.
iv. Dictionary is an unordered data structure because its items cannot be accessed by indexing.

Sure, here's a brief overview of the basics of each data structure:

1. **List**:
   - Ordered collection of items.
   - Mutable, meaning you can change, add, and remove elements after the list is created.
   - Elements are indexed, allowing for easy access and manipulation.
   - Denoted by square brackets `[]`.

2. **Tuple**:
   - Similar to lists, but immutable, meaning once created, elements cannot be changed.
   - Ordered collection of items.
   - Elements are indexed, like lists.
   - Denoted by parentheses `()`.

3. **Set**:
   - Unordered collection of unique elements.
   - Does not allow duplicate elements.
   - Mutable, meaning you can add and remove elements.
   - Does not support indexing.
   - Denoted by curly braces `{}`.

4. **Dictionary**:
   - Collection of key-value pairs.
   - Unordered, but items are accessed by their keys.
   - Keys must be unique and immutable (like tuples), while values can be mutable.
   - Mutable, meaning you can add, remove, or change key-value pairs.
   - Denoted by curly braces `{}`, with key-value pairs separated by colons `:` and items separated by commas `,`.
