# Packages:
    # A package is a collection of modules in directories.
    # It's a way of organizing related modules into a single hierarchy.
    # Packages are identified by the presence of an __init__.py file in the package directory.
    # Packages can contain sub-packages, which are simply subdirectories containing their own __init__.py files.
