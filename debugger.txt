The Python Debugger (PDB) offers a range of commands to interactively debug Python programs. Here's an overview of the most commonly used commands:

1. **h(elp)**: Provides a list of available commands or help on a specific command. For example, typing `help` or `h` will display a list of commands, and `help <command>` will give details about that specific command.

2. **l(ist)**: Shows the current location in the code, typically around the line where the debugger is paused. This command also displays a few lines of code around the current position for context.

3. **n(ext)**: Executes the next line of code, stepping over function calls. If the line is a function call, it will not enter the function and will proceed to the next line in the current function.

4. **s(tep)**: Similar to `next`, but steps into the function if the next line is a function call, allowing you to debug within the function.

5. **r(eturn)**: Continues execution until the current function returns, then pauses again.

6. **c(ontinue)**: Resumes program execution until the next breakpoint is encountered or the program finishes.

7. **b(reak)**: Sets a breakpoint at the specified line number or function. For example, `b 10` sets a breakpoint at line 10, and `b some_function` sets a breakpoint at the beginning of `some_function`.

8. **cl(ear)**: Clears a breakpoint. You can clear a specific breakpoint by specifying its number, or clear all breakpoints with no arguments.

9. **p(rint)**: Evaluates and prints the value of the given expression. For example, `p variable_name` will print the value of `variable_name`.

10. **q(uit)**: Quits the debugger and exits the program.

11. **u(p)**: Moves up the call stack to the caller's frame.

12. **d(own)**: Moves down the call stack to the callee's frame.

13. **a(rgs)**: Displays the arguments of the current function.

14. **w(here)**: Shows the current stack trace, indicating where you are in the code.

15. **unt(il)**: Continues execution until the current line number is greater than the given value.

16. **source**: Displays the source code of the current function.

17. **display**: Evaluates and prints the value of an expression each time execution stops.

These are the fundamental commands, but there are more advanced ones available. Remember, you can always get detailed information on any command by typing `help <command>` within the debugger.
