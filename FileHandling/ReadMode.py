# Read Mode ('r'):
    # Opens a file for reading.
    # The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.
    # Use this mode when you only need to read data from the file and do not intend to modify it.
    # You cannot write in this mode

# read():
    # The read() method reads the entire contents of the file as a single string.
    # It reads the file from the current position of the file pointer (cursor) until the end of the file.
    # If you call read() again on the same file object, it will return an empty string since the file pointer is already at the end of the file.
# readline():
    # The readline() method reads a single line from the file.
    # It reads from the current position of the file pointer until it encounters a newline character ('\n') or reaches the end of the file.
    # Each time you call readline(), it moves the file pointer to the beginning of the next line.
# readlines():
    # The readlines() method reads all the lines of the file and returns them as a list of strings.
    # Each string in the list represents one line of the file, including the newline character ('\n') at the end of each line.
    # If the file is large, this method can consume a lot of memory because it reads the entire file into memory at once.
