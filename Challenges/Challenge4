### Problem Statement

**Objective:**
Develop an algorithm to find the remainder of a given integer x when divided by another integer n without using the modulus (%), division , or floor division (//) operators, and without using loops.

**Input:**

- An integer x (can be positive, negative, or zero).
- A positive integer n.

**Output:**

- The remainder when x is divided by n .

**Constraints:**

1. You cannot use the modulus (%), division , or floor division (//) operators.
2. You cannot use loops.
3. The function should handle both positive and negative values of x .
4. The value of n is guaranteed to be positive.
